# Syllabus for CS 5435

Welcome to CS 5435, introduction to computer security (also called "Security and
Privacy in the Wild"). This course will impart a broad overview of modern
computer security, ranging over topics including authentication, web security,
network security, OS and low-level software security, and abuse prevention.  
A brief introduction to cryptography, e-crime, and socio-technical issues will
be included. Key learning objectives include understanding the role of threat
modeling in the design and evaluation of modern computing systems, how
exploitation of computing systems work, and approaches to finding and
remediating vulnerabilities.

### Course online resources

* Course website ([Github](https://github.com/tomrist/cs5435-spring2024)): This Github repository will include general information about the course and will be updated to include lecture material and slides throughout the semester.

* Course schedule ([Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RySQMcIFWVjv7pONpzzIxiyY2iYKVTZhD9VwoVgrgHU/edit?usp=sharing)): A preliminary schedule is available. The schedule may evolve, but we will try to stick to it particularly with respect to the homeworks.

* Resources and readings ([Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jlQlAgI0DrKJIUiW2FSVUbFf-8xfyAbJHUm7Rhp5rb0/)): Links to various resources, tutorials, research papers, etc., organized by topic.

<!--* Course Q/A ([Piazza](https://piazza.com/tech.cornell/fall2019/cs5435/)): We will be using Piazza for class discussion. Rather than emailing questions on logistics, homeworks, and lecture material to staff, we encourage you to post on Piazza instead.

* Course management system ([CMSX](https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu)): We will be using Cornell's CMSX platform for homework submissions and grading. If the CMSX site does not show up for you, please email the TAs and we can attempt to help fix your enrollment status. -->

* Canvas: zoom link, lecture recordings, homeworks. 


### Pre-requisites

Programming skills and an introductory course on discrete structures and / or algorithms (e.g., CS 2800 or CS 4820). 
Homeworks will require good comfort with javascript and C programming. We will
also have some SQL but you be able to learn what is needed. 

If you are in doubt, talk to instructor.

### Requirements

The class will involve a combination of lectures, homeworks, participation
credit, and opportunities for extra credit. You'll be graded according to the following:

* Homeworks:  90% (each homework will be worth an equal amount)
* Participation:  10% 

Grades will not be curved, so everyone could get an A in the class if
everyone does well. 

We are planning 4 larger homework assignments. A preliminary schedule
of when homeworks will be assigned and when they are due will appear on 
the course schedule linked below. 
Homeworks are due on the due date by 11:59:59pm EST. You can use in
total 3 late days throughout the semeseter. 

We plan to do some extra credit opportunities on homeworks. Also, you can 
get up to 10% extra credit will be available for students that meaningfully
integrate a notable security component to related coursework, e.g., within a
studio project. You may also suggest a project outside your other course work.
More details will come.

I expect everyone to get full credit on participation, but reserve the right to
change participation deliverables should lecture attendance and participation
during lecture become poor. 
The bulk of material will be delivered via lecture, as such you won't get much
out of the class if you skip lectures and won't be prepared for homeworks. 
We are working on lectures being recorded
in case you have to miss class due to interviews, illness, or the like, or want
to review them later. 
There's no need to notify me if you can't attend a lecture, I trust you'll use good
judgement. 



### Background reading 

The course does not have a required textbook. We will try to provide links to
related material and slides will be made available after lectures.
